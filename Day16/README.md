# Day 16 of Python programming bootcamp.

This Python code implements a simple coin-operated coffee service using three modules: "menu," "coffee_maker," and "money_machine." The coffee service allows users to select drinks from a predefined menu, make payments, and receive the ordered drinks. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Importing Modules:**
   - The code imports three modules: `Menu`, `MenuItem` from the "menu" module, `CoffeeMaker` from the "coffee_maker" module, and `MoneyMachine` from the "money_machine" module.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Three instances are created: `cafe_menu` for the menu, `money_machine` for handling payments, and `coffee_maker` for managing the coffee-making process.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program enters a `while` loop (`machine_operating`) that runs as long as the variable is `True`.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - The user is prompted with a welcome message and asked to input their order using the `input` function.
   - If the user inputs 'report', the coffee maker and money machine generate and display reports.
   - If the user inputs 'off', the loop is exited, and a farewell message is printed.

5. **Order Processing:**
   - If the user input is neither 'report' nor 'off', it is treated as a drink order.
   - The code checks if there are sufficient resources (ingredients) in the coffee maker for the selected drink using `coffee_maker.is_resource_sufficient(drink)`.
   - If there are enough resources, the code proceeds to handle payment using `money_machine.make_payment(drink.cost)`.
   - If the payment is successful, the coffee maker prepares the drink with `coffee_maker.make_coffee(drink)`.

6. **Exit Message:**
   - After the loop ends (when the user enters 'off'), a closing message is displayed.

In summary, this code represents a basic coin-operated coffee service that allows users to interact with a menu, place orders, make payments, and receive drinks. The service also provides functionality for generating reports on the status of the coffee maker and money machine.
