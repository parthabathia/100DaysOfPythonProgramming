# Day 19 of Python programming bootcamp

This Python code utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create a simple turtle race game. Here's a description of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - `Turtle` and `Screen` classes are imported from the `turtle` module.
   - The `random` module is imported to generate random distances for the turtles.

2. **Setting up the Screen:**
   - A Turtle graphics screen is created with a width of 500 and height of 400 pixels.

3. **Defining Colors and Turtles:**
   - A list of colors ("violet", "indigo", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange", "red") is defined for the turtles.
   - An empty list called `all_turtles` is created to store the turtle objects.

4. **Setting up Players (Turtles):**
   - The `set_players` function is defined to create turtle objects with different colors, positioned in a column on the left side of the screen.

5. **Starting the Race:**
   - The `start_race` function is defined, which takes a user's bet as an argument.
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `is_race_on` based on whether the user has placed a bet.
   - A while loop runs until the race is over (`is_race_on` becomes `False`).
   - Within the loop, each turtle in `all_turtles` moves forward a random distance.
   - If a turtle crosses a certain x-coordinate threshold (230), the race ends, and the winning turtle's color is determined.
   - The user's bet is then compared with the winning color, and a message is printed indicating whether the user has won or lost.

6. **User Interaction:**
   - The `set_players` function is called to create the turtles.
   - The user is prompted to make a bet on the winning turtle's color using the `screen.textinput` method.
   - The user's bet is passed to the `start_race` function to initiate the race.

7. **Closing the Program:**
   - After the race is completed, the program waits for the user to click on the screen to exit (`screen.exitonclick()`).

Overall, the code simulates a turtle race where the user can make a bet on the winning turtle, and the winner is determined based on the turtle that reaches the finish line first.
