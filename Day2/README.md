# Day 2 of 100 days of Python programming bootcamp

This repository contains a Python code for a Tip Calculator.

In this project, we take multiple inputs from the user. The first input is the total amount of the bill in dollars. The second input would be the percentage of tip, viz. 10, 12 or 15. The third input will be the number of people.

The program will then calculate the tip amount based on the bill amount and tip percentage. The tip amount will be added to the bill amount and final amount will be divided based on the number of people.

The program will then output the amount payable by each person.
