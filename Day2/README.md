# Day 2 of 100 days of Python programming bootcamp

This Python code is a simple tip calculator program. It:

    Welcomes the user and prompts them for information.
    Gets the bill amount and converts it to a float for calculations.
    Asks the user for their desired tip percentage from three options.
    Finds the number of people to split the bill among.
    Calculates the total cost per person by adding the tip (calculated from the bill amount and tip percentage) and dividing by the number of people.
    Displays the cost per person with a formatted string, including two decimal places.

Overall, this code provides a user-friendly way to calculate and split a restaurant bill with a tip, including dividing the cost among multiple people.

Feel free to explore and play around with the code. Branch the code to improve the overall mechanics or user experience.
