# Day 4 of 100 days of Python programming bootcamp

This code is a basic implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in Python.

Features:

    Players choose their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) through a numbered prompt.
    The computer randomly chooses its move.
    The game determines the winner based on the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules.
    Outputs show the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the game result (win, lose, or draw).

Technical details:

    Uses random.randint to generate the computer's choice.
    Employs conditional statements (if-else) to handle different scenarios based on player and computer choices.
    Utilizes multiple strings (rock, paper, scissors) to display visuals for each option.

Overall, this code provides a fun and interactive way to play Rock Paper Scissors with a virtual opponent.

Feel free to explore and play around with the code. Branch the code to improve on the overall mechanics or user experience.
