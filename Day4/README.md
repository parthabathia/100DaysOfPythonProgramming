# Day 4 of 100 days of Python programming bootcamp

This repository contains a Python Code for a mini game Rock, Paper and Scissors. The game is played between a user and the computer.

The game requires users to choose from either Rock, Paper or Scissors and a random selection is made for the computer.

## Rules of the game.

1. Rock triumphs over Scissors. (Rock > Scissor)
2. Paper triumphs over Rock. (Paper > Rock)
3. Scissors triumphs over Paper. (Scissor > Paper)

Based on the user and computer selections, and considering the rules mentioned above, the output received would either be 'Its a draw', 'You won' or 'You lost'.

Feel free to explore the code and have an experience yourself. 

Bonus: ASCII drawings are added to make it more entertaining.
