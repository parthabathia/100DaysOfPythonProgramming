# Day 8 of Python programming bootcamp

This Python code implements a Caesar cipher encoder and decoder with a user-friendly interface. Here's a breakdown:

Features:

    Encodes and Decodes: Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt their messages.
    User Input: Prompts for direction, message text, and shift amount.
    Shift Numbers: Accepts integer values for the desired shift in the alphabet.
    Looping: Allows users to encode/decode multiple messages before exiting.
    Artistic Logo: Displays a visually appealing logo before starting.

Overall, the code provides a simple and interactive way to apply the Caesar cipher for basic text encryption and decryption.

Additional Notes:

    The code imports functions from CaeserCodeDecode and CaeserArt modules (not shown).
    The code assumes lowercase input for both messages and direction.

Let me know if you have any further questions about the specific parts of the code.
