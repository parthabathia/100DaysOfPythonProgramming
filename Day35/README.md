# Day 35 of Python programming bootcamp

This Python script fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API to determine if you need an umbrella based on the forecast for a specific location. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Import Statements**: The script imports necessary modules including `requests` for making HTTP requests, `os` for environment variables (though not used in this script), and `Client` from the `twilio.rest` module for sending SMS messages using Twilio.

2. **Constants Definition**: It defines constants such as `ACCOUNT_SID`, `AUTH_TOKEN`, `MY_LAT` (latitude), `MY_LONG` (longitude), `OWM_api_key` (OpenWeatherMap API key), and `API_endpoint_forecast` and `API_endpoint_weather` for the API endpoints.

3. **API Request**: It constructs parameters for the API request including latitude, longitude, API key, units, and count. It then makes a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap forecast API endpoint using `requests.get()`.

4. **Response Handling**: It checks the response status, raises an exception if there's an error, and then parses the JSON response into `weather_data`.

5. **Umbrella Check**: It iterates through the forecast data to check if any weather condition codes indicate rain (code < 700). If rain is predicted (`need_umbrella` is set to `True`), it proceeds to send an SMS message using Twilio to remind you to bring an umbrella.

6. **Twilio SMS**: If `need_umbrella` is `True`, it initializes a Twilio client with the provided account SID and authentication token, then sends an SMS message with the body "Bring an umbrella" from a temporary Twilio number to your specified phone number.

7. **Print Status**: It prints the status of the message sent by Twilio.

Overall, this script automates the process of checking the weather forecast and sending an SMS reminder to bring an umbrella if rain is predicted.
