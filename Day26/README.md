# Day 26 of Python programming bootcamp

The provided Python code utilizes the pandas library to read a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet mapping. It then prompts the user to input a word, converts the input word to uppercase, and maps each letter of the word to its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet representation. Finally, it prints the resulting NATO phonetic alphabet representation of the user-entered word.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Importing the pandas library:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ```

   This line imports the pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

2. **Reading the CSV file:**
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv("nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv")
   ```

   The code reads a CSV file named "nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv" using pandas and stores the data in a DataFrame called `data`.

3. **Creating a dictionary for the NATO phonetic alphabet:**
   ```python
   alphabet_dict = {row.letter: row.code for index, row in data.iterrows()}
   ```

   The code iterates over the rows of the DataFrame and creates a dictionary (`alphabet_dict`) where the keys are the letters of the alphabet, and the values are their corresponding NATO phonetic representations.

4. **Taking user input:**
   ```python
   user_word = input("Enter a word: ")
   ```

   The code prompts the user to enter a word, and the input is stored in the variable `user_word`.

5. **Converting the user input to uppercase:**
   ```python
   user_word_as_list = [letter.upper() for letter in user_word]
   ```

   The code converts each letter of the user-entered word to uppercase and stores the result as a list in `user_word_as_list`.

6. **Mapping letters to NATO phonetic alphabet representations:**
   ```python
   nato_word_for_user_word = [alphabet_dict[letter] for letter in user_word_as_list]
   ```

   The code maps each letter of the user-entered word to its corresponding NATO phonetic representation using the previously created `alphabet_dict`. The resulting NATO phonetic alphabet representations are stored in the list `nato_word_for_user_word`.

7. **Printing the result:**
   ```python
   print(nato_word_for_user_word)
   ```

   Finally, the code prints the NATO phonetic alphabet representation of the user-entered word.
