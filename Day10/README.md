# Day 10 of Python programming bootcamp

This Python code implements a basic interactive calculator with ASCII art and the ability to chain operations.

Key functionalities:

    Prints a welcome banner using CalculatorArt.logo.
    Defines four functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
    Stores these functions in a dictionary (operations) mapped to their corresponding symbols (+, -, *, /).
    Prompts user for the first number and then displays available operations.
    Enters a loop where the user selects an operation and enters a second number.
    Performs the chosen operation on the two numbers and prints the result.
    Allows user to choose to continue calculating with the result, start a new calculation, or exit the program.

Overall, this code demonstrates several programming concepts including:

    Function definition and usage
    Dictionaries and key-value pairs
    User input and output
    Conditional statements and looping

This is a basic calculator and can be extended to include additional features like more complex operations, error handling, and a more user-friendly interface.

Feel free to explore and play around with the code. All the dependencies are also provided in the repository. Branch the code to improve on the overall mechanics or user experience.
