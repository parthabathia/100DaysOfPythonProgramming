# Day 1 of 100 days of Python programming bootcamp

This Python code snippet implements a simple band name generator. It prompts the user for two inputs:

    City name: Where the user grew up, potentially representing their roots or inspiration.
    Pet's name: A playful element, likely evoking personal connection or quirkiness.

Once the user provides these inputs, the code combines them and displays the resulting combination as a potential band name. This offers a lighthearted and personalized approach to generating band names.

Key points:

    User-friendly, interactive format.
    Combines personal details for a unique touch.
    Simple and concise implementation.

Feel free to explore and play around with the code. Branch the code to improve the overall mechanics or user experience.
