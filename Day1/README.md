# Day 1 of 100 days of Python programming bootcamp

This repository contains Python code for a band name generator.

The program will take multiple inputs from the user. The first input is the city in which the user belongs and the second is the name of the user's pet.

The program will then concatenate the name of the city and the name of the pet to give the user their band's name.
