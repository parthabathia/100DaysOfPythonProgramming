# Day 9 of Python programming bootcamp

This Python code simulates a simple silent auction with the following functionalities:

    Welcome: Prints a decorative logo and a welcome message.
    Bidding Loop:
        Asks for a bidder's name and their bidding amount.
        Stores the bidder name and amount in a dictionary named bidders.
        Tracks all bid amounts in a separate list named amount_list.
        Asks if there are more people to bid using a Yes/No prompt.
        Clears the console screen after each loop iteration.
    Winner Determination:
        Once no more bidders, it finds the highest bid amount in amount_list.
        Iterates through the bidders dictionary and finds the bidder associated with the highest amount.
        Prints the winning bidder's name and their winning bid amount.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for simulating a silent auction with manual bidding and winner identification.

Feel free to explore and play around with the code. All the dependencies are also provided in the repository. Branch the code to improve on the overall mechanics or user experience.
