This Python code implements a simple "Higher or Lower" game where the player compares the number of followers between two randomly selected social media accounts. Here's a description of the code:

1. The code imports the ASCII art for the game's logo and the "vs" symbol, as well as the game data (information about various social media accounts) and necessary libraries.

2. The `get_data` function selects a random social media account from the provided data.

3. The `format_data` function takes a social media account as input and formats its information (name, description, and country) into a printable string.

4. The `check_answer` function takes the follower counts of two accounts and the player's answer, then checks if the player's answer is correct by comparing the follower counts.

5. The `game` function initializes two social media accounts, starts a loop for comparing follower counts, and prompts the player to guess which account has more followers. The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess, and the final score is displayed.

6. The main part of the code clears the console screen and asks the player if they want to play the game. If the player chooses to play, the game loop is executed; otherwise, a farewell message is displayed.

Note: The `system('cls')` statements are used to clear the console screen, and they may need to be adjusted based on the operating system (e.g., 'cls' for Windows, 'clear' for Unix-like systems).
