# Day 28 of Python programming bootcamp

The provided code is a Python script for creating a simple Pomodoro Timer GUI application using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After completing a certain number of work intervals, a longer break is taken.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Constants:**
   - Various color constants (`PINK`, `RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`) and a font constant (`FONT_NAME`) are defined.
   - Duration constants for work, short break, and long break periods (`WORK_MIN`, `SHORT_BREAK_MIN`, `LONG_BREAK_MIN`).
   - Other constants include the initial number of repetitions (`reps`), a checkmark symbol (`CHECK_MARK`), and a variable for the timer (`timer`).

2. **Timer Reset:**
   - The `reset_timer` function resets the timer and related labels to their initial state. It cancels any ongoing timer, resets the timer label, clears checkmarks, and resets the canvas timer text.

3. **Timer Mechanism:**
   - The `start_timer` function is responsible for starting the timer based on the current phase (work, short break, long break).
   - It updates the timer label and initiates the countdown with the corresponding duration.

4. **Countdown Mechanism:**
   - The `countdown` function handles the countdown logic.
   - It converts the total seconds into minutes and seconds, updates the canvas timer text, and recursively calls itself with a countdown of one second.
   - When the countdown reaches zero, it calls the `start_timer` function and updates the checkmarks label.

5. **UI Setup:**
   - The Tkinter window is created with the title "Pomodoro Timer" and specific padding and background color.
   - Labels, canvas, and buttons are configured and placed within the window to create the user interface.
   - The UI includes a timer label, a tomato image on a canvas representing the timer, start and reset buttons, and a label for displaying checkmarks.

6. **Main Loop:**
   - The `mainloop()` function is called to start the Tkinter event loop, allowing the user to interact with the Pomodoro Timer GUI.

The Pomodoro Timer works by initiating work intervals, short breaks, and a long break after a set number of work intervals. The timer displays the time remaining, and the user can start, reset, and track completed intervals through checkmarks. The UI elements are styled using predefined constants to maintain a consistent look throughout the application.
