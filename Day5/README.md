# Day 5 of 100 days of Python programming bootcamp

Brief Description of the Code:

This Python code generates a random password based on user-specified criteria. Here's a breakdown:

1. Initialization:

    Imports necessary modules (random).
    Defines lists for uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    Welcomes the user and prompts for the desired number of each character type in the password.

2. User Input:

    Validates user input for number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
    Calculates the total password length based on user choices.

3. Password Generation:

    Initializes an empty string variable for the password.
    Loops for each desired character type (letters, numbers, symbols):
        For each loop iteration, randomly selects a character from the corresponding list and adds it to the password string.

4. Randomization:

    Shuffles the password string to avoid predictable patterns.

5. Output:

    Prints the final generated password to the user.

Overall, this code aims to create secure and unique passwords by incorporating user preferences and randomizing the character selection.
